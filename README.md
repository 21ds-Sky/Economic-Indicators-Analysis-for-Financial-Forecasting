# TCS-ion-AI-industry-project-Developing-a-Model-to-Identify-Factors-Affecting-Country-GDP

Problem Statement 
An agency has decided to study the different factors that affect the country’s GDP. For this purpose, they have collected the data of 227 countries which includes – name of the country, region, population, area, population density, coastline area, net migration, infant mortality, GDP, literacy, phones per 1000, arable, crops, climate, birth-rate, deathrate, agriculture, industry, service, others.

Data Set 
CSV dataset – gdpWorld.csv 
What is expected 
Identify at least six factors that affect the GDP of a country. Apply any linear and non-linear model on the dataset with these six factors and compare the two models to find which gives a more accurate prediction. 


In response to the Industry Assignment by TCS ion, I undertook a comprehensive study on the factors influencing a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Leveraging Artificial Intelligence, I analyzed a dataset comprising 227 countries, exploring various parameters such as population, area, literacy, and more.

Factors Explored:
Population
Literacy
Phones per 1000
Birth-rate
Death rate
Industry
Methodology:
I employed both linear and non-linear models to predict a country's GDP based on the identified factors. This holistic approach aimed to determine the model that provides the most accurate predictions.

Linear Model:
Utilizing traditional linear regression, I established a baseline for comparison. This model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and GDP.

Non-linear Model:
Incorporating advanced non-linear models, such as [insert model names here], I sought to capture complex relationships within the data that might be missed by linear models.

Results:
The performance of both models was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall. A detailed comparison revealed insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model in predicting GDP.
