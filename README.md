Problem Statement
----------------------
An agency aims to understand the factors influencing a countryâ€™s GDP. The dataset includes data of 227 countries, encompassing parameters like population, area, literacy, and more.

Dataset
-------------
CSV dataset: gdpWorld.csv

Objective
----------------
Identify six factors affecting a country's GDP and apply linear and non-linear models to predict GDP. Compare model performance to determine the most accurate prediction.

Approach
----------------
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to identify relevant factors influencing GDP.
Feature Selection: Select six factors based on their potential impact on GDP.
Model Development:
Linear Model: Utilize linear regression to establish a baseline prediction.
Non-linear Model: Implement advanced non-linear models like XGBRegressor.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
Comparison: Compare the performance of linear and non-linear models to determine the most accurate prediction of GDP.


Results
-----------
The comparative analysis of linear and non-linear models provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in predicting GDP. This study aids in understanding the key factors driving a country's economic growth and informs decision-making processes.
